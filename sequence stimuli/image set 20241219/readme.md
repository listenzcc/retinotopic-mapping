# The images set

---

## Diff and same images

The "diff" prefix refers the images are marked with different classes for colorful and hed modes.
The "same" prefix refers the images classes are the same between colorful and hed modes.

## Colorful and HED

The "colorful" mode refers the images are displayed with its raw color.
The "hed" mode refers the images classes are displayed with their HED edge features.

## Diff images

The set1 and set2 are two parts of all the images, in the random splitting.
The set3 and set4 are also two parts of all the images, but in another random splitting.

To make sure both colorful and hed modes image are shown,
I suggest displaying them as

- Diff set1 with colorful mode.
- Diff set3 with hed mode.
- Diff set2 with colorful mode.
- Diff set4 with hed mode.

Or if you only have short time

- Diff set1 with colorful mode.
- Diff set1 with hed mode.

In another round (if there is another round)

- Diff set2 with colorful mode.
- Diff set2 with hed mode.

## Same images

Since there are much more "same" images, so I just picked some of them separately in set1 and set2.

I suggest displaying them as

- Same set1 with colorful mode.
- Same set1 with hed mode.

In another round (if there is another round)

- Same set2 with colorful mode.
- Same set2 with hed mode.
